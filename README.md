ToDo
----

* [x] Scan folders and build thumbnails
* [x] Scan folders and store metadata
* [ ] Zip thumbnails - I don't like thousands of small files
* [x] Load all meta information into RAM to do queries
* [ ] Accept HTTP requests to query different things
* [ ] Make React app to show images and filter by all metadata
* [ ] ScanDir should skip non-image files
* [ ] Add scanning Exif data to the database
* [ ] Add scanning redis queue and give tasks to the queue

Later:
* [ ] Add editing sources in UI
